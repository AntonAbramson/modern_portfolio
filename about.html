            I am an avid film photographer and cinematographer, and ride

          <h3>San Francisco State University</h3>
          <h6>BS in Computer Science and Marketing Minor</h6>
          <p>
            In order to continue with my education, I transferred to San
            Francisco State University to pursue a BS degree in Computer
            Science. At SFSU, I was able to deduce my concentrated field of
            interest and focus on the curriculum I was most passionate about.
            After a handful of algorithm and software development courses, I
            realized that a topic I found most interesting was front-end
            development. Due to my involvement with the scootering industry both
            in front and behind the scenes, I was introduced to a lot of
            business and marketing practices that influenced me to pursue a
            minor in Marketing. Pairing the two fields together, I found Data
            Analysis to be another topic that sparked my interest. After
            graduating from SFSU in 2020, I hope to find a position in those
            respective fields that both challenges me and hones in on the skills
            I have developed throughout my many experiences.

          <h3>De Anza College</h3>
          <h6>Transfer to University</h6>
          <p>
            I attended De Anza College in Cupertino, CA, and took a variety of
            classes from psychology and sociology, to astronomy and photography,
            before discovering my passion for computer science. De Anza offered
            me introductory and intermediate courses in both C++ and Java, and
            introduced me to topics such as Data Structures, Assembly Language,
            and UML Diagrams. Studying at De Anza gave me the opportunity to
            explore a wide range of subjects, acquiring knowledge that is
            relevant to my everyday life and a new perspective on how to
            approach any problem I may face.

          <h3>Involvement in Freestyle Scootering Industry</h3>
          <h6>Professional Rider and Cinematographer</h6>
          <p>
            My first introduction to freestyle scootering was a YouTube video I
            stumbled upon at the age of 11. The video was of professional
            scooter rider Coedie Donovan performing tricks I didnâ€™t even think
            were possible. Since then, I have taken a head-first dive into the
            rapidly growing sport of scootering and developed a passion for the
            extreme. After 11 years of riding, I have risen to the rank of
            professional and currently hold 4 sponsors. Through my involvement,
            along with all the countless sprains, bruises and broken bones, I
            have developed a skill for cinematography that has allowed me to
            work within the industry, creating videos and promotional content
            for various companies.
