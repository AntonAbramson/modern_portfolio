          <h3>San Francisco State University</h3>
          <h6>BS in Computer Science and Marketing Minor</h6>
          <p>
            To continue my education, I transferred to San Francisco State
            University in the fall of 2017 to pursue a BS degree in Computer
            Science. At SFSU, I was able to determine my concentrated field of
            interest and begin to focus on the curriculum I was most passionate
            about. After a handful of algorithm and software development
            courses, I developed a strong interest in front-end development. Due
            to my involvement with the scootering industry both in front and
            behind the scenes, I was introduced to a several business and
            marketing practices, inspiring me to pursue a minor in Marketing. in
            pairing the two fields together, I found Data Analysis to be another
            topic that sparked my interest. After graduating from SFSU in 2020,
            I hope to find a position in one of the aforementioned fields that
            both challenges me and allows me to further hone the skills I have
            developed by way of my eclectic set of interests

          <h3>De Anza College</h3>
          <h6>Transfer to University</h6>
          <p>
            After finishing high school, I attended De Anza College in
            Cupertino, CA, and took a variety of classes, from psychology to
            sociology, astronomy to photography, before ultimately discovering
            my passion for computer science. De Anza offered me introductory and
            intermediate courses in both C++ and Java, and introduced me to more
            complex topics such as Data Structures, Assembly Language, and UML
            Diagrams. Studying at De Anza gave me the opportunity to explore a
            wide range of subjects and acquire knowledge relevant to my everyday
            life, in turn cultivating a new perspective on how to approach any
            problem I may face.

          <h3>Involvement in Freestyle Scootering Industry</h3>
          <h6>Professional Rider and Cinematographer</h6>
          <p>
            My first introduction to freestyle scootering came in the form of a
            YouTube video which I stumbled upon at the age of 11. The video
            showed professional scooter rider Coedie Donovan performing tricks
            that, at the time, I didnâ€™t think were possible. Since then, I have
            taken a head-first dive into the rapidly growing sport of scootering
            and developed a passion for the extreme. After 11 years of riding, I
            have risen to the rank of professional and currently hold four
            sponsors. Alongside bettering by own riding skill, I have developed
            a focused interest in cinematography, allowing me to participate in
            the creation of videos and other promotional content for several
            notable companies within the scootering industry.
